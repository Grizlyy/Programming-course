              <p>Whitney Jones is an American IFBB Pro Fitness athlete, personal trainer, model, and gym owner. Her
                career peaked in 2018, after winning the bodybuilding’s two top titles – 2018 Arnold Classic and
                Ms. Fitness Olympia. However, Whitney didn’t initially consider a career in fitness. Although she
                trained and created her own meal plans, she saw this as just a hobby. In time, though, Whitney
                realized fitness was her biggest passion and decided to go all-in; becoming a full-time model,
                personal trainer, and competitor.</p>

                competing at a high level all the way through college. Later on, as her passion for fitness grew,

                debut 2012 Nationals, subsequently entering the Pro Circuit. From there, the only way was up. The
                inspired Cydney went on to win back-to-back 2017 and 2018 Ms. Figure Olympia titles, along with
